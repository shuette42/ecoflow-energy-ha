# PowerPulse 2 - Entity Reference

Full list of all entities created for the EcoFlow PowerPulse 2 wallbox (C376 series).

**Totals:** 16 sensors, 1 binary sensor

> **Enhanced Mode only.** The wallbox reports through the account connection, not through the EcoFlow Developer API. A Standard Mode setup gets error 1006 and no entities fill; set the integration up with an EcoFlow account e-mail and password instead.

The PowerPulse 2 is its own device type and does not need a paired PowerOcean. Earlier releases only saw these readings once a PowerOcean was coupled to relay them, so a wallbox without one showed nothing at all. The integration now reads the wallbox's own reporting channel directly.

Four of the sensors below - Wallbox Charging Power, Wallbox Session Energy, Wallbox Session Duration and Wallbox Charging Status - used to live on the PowerOcean device when a PowerPulse 2 was coupled to one. They now live here, under entity IDs built from the wallbox's own serial number, and the four PowerOcean-side entries are removed from the entity registry on the first start after the update. History and statistics recorded under the old IDs do not carry over, and an automation, a dashboard card or an Energy Dashboard slot that named one of them needs the new entity. The vehicle reading stays on the PowerOcean, because only the earlier PowerPulse reports one. Nothing changes for the earlier PowerPulse (`AC31` series): it keeps reporting through its PowerOcean on the same five entities as before.

Read-only. The integration cannot start, stop or configure a charging session.

## Sensors

| Entity | Unit | Category | Default | Description |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|
| Wallbox Charging Power | W | - | enabled | Power currently going into the vehicle |
| Wallbox Voltage L1 | V | - | enabled | Line voltage on phase 1 |
| Wallbox Voltage L2 | V | - | enabled | Line voltage on phase 2 |
| Wallbox Voltage L3 | V | - | enabled | Line voltage on phase 3 |
| Wallbox Current L1 | A | - | enabled | Current on phase 1 |
| Wallbox Current L2 | A | - | enabled | Current on phase 2. Reads 0 A while charging single-phase |
| Wallbox Current L3 | A | - | enabled | Current on phase 3. Reads 0 A while charging single-phase |
| Wallbox Maximum Current | A | diagnostic | enabled | The configured current limit, not a live measurement |
| Wallbox Phase Mode | - | diagnostic | enabled | `single_phase` or `three_phase` |
| Wallbox Session Status | - | diagnostic | enabled | `idle`, `charging` or `finished` |
| Wallbox Session Duration | s | diagnostic | enabled | How long the current session has been running. Absent while no session is running, see the note below |
| Wallbox Charging Status | - | - | enabled | Available, preparing, charging, paused by charger, paused by vehicle, finishing, or fault |
| Wallbox Session Start | - | diagnostic | enabled | When the current session began. Absent while no session is running |
| Wallbox Session Energy | Wh | - | enabled | Energy delivered in the current session. Resets with every new session, so it is not a lifetime counter. Absent while no session is running |
| Wallbox Session Start Meter | Wh | diagnostic | enabled | The lifetime counter's reading at the moment the current session began. Absent while no session is running |
| Wallbox Total Energy | Wh | - | enabled | Lifetime counter, energy delivered by the wallbox over its whole life |

## Binary Sensors

| Entity | Category | Default | Description |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---|
| Wallbox Cable Lock | diagnostic | enabled | Whether the cable's permanent lock, used as a theft deterrent, is switched on |

## Controls

None. The wallbox reports; it does not accept commands.

## Notes

### The four session readings are absent, not zero, between sessions

Wallbox Session Start, Wallbox Session Duration, Wallbox Session Energy and Wallbox Session Start Meter only exist while a session is actually running. Once the session ends, the wallbox stops reporting them and the entities go unavailable instead of settling on the last session's numbers - showing the previous session's duration or energy as if it were still counting would be worse than showing nothing.

### The cable lock can take a while to appear

Wallbox Cable Lock is only carried in the wallbox's bundled status report, never in a single push update. A setup that only sees pushes will not see this entity until the wallbox happens to send its bundle, which can take a while after startup.

### The wallbox is quiet between changes

The PowerPulse 2 reports when something changes and otherwise stays silent, charging or not. Over a complete seven-hour recording the longest silence was 50 minutes. The integration therefore waits 20 minutes before it asks the wallbox for a fresh report and keeps the entities available through an hour of silence; on every other device type that watch is much shorter. A wallbox that has gone offline is shown as unavailable after an hour, not after ten minutes.

### Single-phase charging

When the vehicle charges single-phase, only Wallbox Current L1 carries a real reading; Wallbox Current L2 and Wallbox Current L3 read 0 A.
