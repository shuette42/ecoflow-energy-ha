# PowerPulse 2 - Entity Reference

Full list of all entities created for the EcoFlow PowerPulse 2 wallbox (C376 series).

**Totals:** 16 sensors, 1 binary sensor

> **Enhanced Mode only.** The wallbox reports through the account connection, not through the EcoFlow Developer API. A Standard Mode setup gets error 1006 and no entities fill; set the integration up with an EcoFlow account e-mail and password instead.

The PowerPulse 2 is its own device type and does not need a paired PowerOcean. Earlier releases only saw these readings once a PowerOcean was coupled to relay them, so a wallbox without one showed nothing at all. The integration now reads the wallbox's own reporting channel directly.

Four of the sensors below - Wallbox Charging Power, Wallbox Session Energy, Wallbox Session Duration and Wallbox Charging Status - used to live on the PowerOcean device. They kept their name, their entity ID and their recorded history when they moved here; nothing needs to be reconfigured or re-added to the Energy Dashboard.

Read-only. The integration cannot start, stop or configure a charging session.

## Sensors

| Entity | Unit | Category | Default | Description |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|
| Wallbox Charging Power | W | - | enabled | Power currently going into the vehicle |
| Wallbox Voltage L1 | V | - | enabled | Line voltage on phase 1 |
| Wallbox Voltage L2 | V | - | enabled | Line voltage on phase 2 |
| Wallbox Voltage L3 | V | - | enabled | Line voltage on phase 3 |
| Wallbox Current L1 | A | - | enabled | Current on phase 1 |
| Wallbox Current L2 | A | - | enabled | Current on phase 2. Reads 0 A while charging single-phase |
| Wallbox Current L3 | A | - | enabled | Current on phase 3. Reads 0 A while charging single-phase |
| Wallbox Maximum Current | A | diagnostic | enabled | The configured current limit, not a live measurement |
| Wallbox Phase Mode | - | diagnostic | enabled | `single_phase` or `three_phase` |
| Wallbox Session Status | - | diagnostic | enabled | `idle`, `charging` or `finished` |
| Wallbox Session Duration | s | diagnostic | enabled | How long the current session has been running. Absent while no session is running, see the note below |
| Wallbox Charging Status | - | - | enabled | Available, preparing, charging, paused by charger, paused by vehicle, finishing, or fault |
| Wallbox Session Start | - | diagnostic | enabled | When the current session began. Absent while no session is running |
| Wallbox Session Energy | Wh | - | enabled | Energy delivered in the current session. Resets with every new session, so it is not a lifetime counter. Absent while no session is running |
| Wallbox Session Start Meter | Wh | diagnostic | enabled | The lifetime counter's reading at the moment the current session began. Absent while no session is running |
| Wallbox Total Energy | Wh | - | enabled | Lifetime counter, energy delivered by the wallbox over its whole life |

## Binary Sensors

| Entity | Category | Default | Description |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---|
| Wallbox Cable Lock | diagnostic | enabled | Whether the cable's permanent lock, used as a theft deterrent, is switched on |

---

## Controls

None. The wallbox reports; it does not accept commands.

## Notes

### The four session readings are absent, not zero, between sessions

Wallbox Session Start, Wallbox Session Duration, Wallbox Session Energy and Wallbox Session Start Meter only exist while a session is actually running. Once the session ends, the wallbox stops reporting them and the entities go unavailable instead of settling on the last session's numbers - showing the previous session's duration or energy as if it were still counting would be worse than showing nothing.

### The cable lock can take a while to appear

Wallbox Cable Lock is only carried in the wallbox's bundled status report, never in a single push update. A setup that only sees pushes will not see this entity until the wallbox happens to send its bundle, which can take a while after startup.

### Single-phase charging

When the vehicle charges single-phase, only Wallbox Current L1 carries a real reading; Wallbox Current L2 and Wallbox Current L3 read 0 A.
